No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry

[Verse 1]
I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
Oba, observing the hypocrites
As they would mingle with the good people we meet
Good friends we have had, oh good friends we've lost along the way (way)
In this bright future you can't forget your past
So dry your tears I say

[Chorus]
No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry
Little darling don't shed no tears
No woman, no cry

[Verse 2]
Said, said, said I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
And then Georgie would make the fire light
Log wood burning through the night
Then we would cook corn meal porridge
Of which I'll share with you

My feet is my only carriage

So I've got to push on through
But while I'm gone

Everything's going to be alright [x8]

No woman, no cry [x2]
No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry
